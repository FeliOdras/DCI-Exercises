                    <p>
                        One summer, while touring with the music festival Vans Warped Tour, I asked a young man when
                        he’d
                        become a Christian. We struck up a conversation waiting in line for catering, first gazing
                        absently
                        into our phone screens, only to grow bored. Eventually, we mustered the courage to ask the lame
                        adage, “What do you do?” I told him about the work our non-profit did, and it surprised him
                        that a
                        Christian organization involved in mental health was at Warped Tour. Looking around the room,
                        he
                        confided in a low voice that he, too, was a Christian. Within the Warped Tour staffing,
                        Christians
                        are a minority and anomaly. We all know one another and often gather to pray or connect.
                        Curious
                        that I’d not met him before, I asked how long he’d been following the faith, assuming he was a
                        newer Christian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Well, I was born into a Christian home in California.”<br />
                        “And?” I asked incredulous.<br />
                        “So that’s when I became a Christian!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was it. His entire explanation why he was a Christian revolved around being born in
                        California
                        to a Christian household. It was like hearing someone exclaim they were a Republican or
                        Democrat
                        because that’s the environment their parents raised them in. Baffled by the interaction, I
                        asked
                        similar and pointed question over the years to those who identified as “Christian.” Most in the
                        pews of the church I found had wandered into a system of beliefs that resembled cultural
                        conversion
                        or therapeutic feel good relativism. Ultimately, this question explained why the Western church
                        is
                        a mess and why so many who claim the title “Christian” are bigoted, hypocritical, and
                        judgmental.

                    <h2>The Cult of Feel Good Deism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sociologists Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton coined the term “Moralistic
                        Therapeutic
                        Deism” after interviews with 3,000 teenagers. What they discovered is that many of today’s
                        youth
                        view religion and Christianity under the following set of core beliefs:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>God wants people to be nice and fair to one another.</li>
                        <li>The central goal of life is to be happy and to feel good about oneself.</li>
                        <li>God doesn’t need to be involved in your life, unless something is going wrong and you need
                            it
                            resolved</li>
                        <li>Good people go to heaven when they die</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Most adults ascribe to this view of moral and therapeutic deism as well. God is a cosmic genie
                        or
                        butler who gives you Werther’s Original candies — much like your WWII vet grandad did — as long
                        as
                        you’re nice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Orthodox Christian beliefs thus become whatever makes you feel good or makes you happy. When I
                        say
                        “orthodox” I don’t mean secondary or tertiary issues like <em>“When was the Earth made? How
                            about
                            tattoos and alcohol? Do we have free will?”</em> I mean essential core beliefs that define
                        Christianity. Stuff like — Jesus was God and man, born of a virgin, died on a cross,
                        resurrected,
                        commands you to love your neighbor as yourself, instructs you to die to self, and asks that you
                        create other followers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mark of today’s Christian, however, is you do you. Be happy and believe whatever you want.
                        Just
                        be nice to each other and you’ll reach the pearly gates. You may think I’m making this up, but
                        in
                        2016, LifeWay Research confirmed the vast majority of self identifying Christians believed
                        this,
                        and 73% of America claims they’re Christians.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There’s one major problem with this thought process though. You can’t remove a few screws from
                        a
                        bicycle essential to holding it together without the bike falling apart. If Christianity is all
                        about happiness, then what about those pesky orthodox beliefs? New York Times columnist
                        Nicholas
                        Kristof questioned popular New York City pastor, Tim Keller, on why he couldn’t just accept
                        Jesus
                        as a nice guy and emulate his kindness, while still calling himself a Christian. Keller
                        responded:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        ”If something is truly integral to a body of thought, you can’t remove it without destabilizing
                        the
                        whole thing. A religion can’t be whatever we desire it to be. If I’m a member of the board of
                        Greenpeace and I come out and say climate change is a hoax, they will ask me to resign. I could
                        call them narrow-minded, but they would rightly say that there have to be some boundaries for
                        dissent or you couldn’t have a cohesive, integrated organization. And they’d be right. It’s the
                        same with any religious faith.”

                    <h2>Most Christians Can’t Even Explain What They Believe</h2>
                    <p>Here’s a fun trick to play on Christians, especially if you want to expose their hypocrisy. Just
                        ask
                        them,</p>
                    <h3 class="question">
                        “Please explain the Gospel.”
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        For those not of the Christian faith, the gospel is the defining belief by which all Christian
                        traditions hinge their faith on (should you care for a more in-depth explanation, I’ve written
                        a
                        popular piece about that here). My moment of horror came the day I asked a group of
                        twenty-somethings the question — what is the gospel? The mix of confusion, babbling, and absurd
                        declarations were genuinely breathtaking. That they couldn’t explain the essential message of
                        their
                        faith meant they didn’t even know it to begin with. Instead, most I’ve encountered can tell you
                        about their moral behavior or when they said a prayer to invite Jesus into their heart (which
                        is
                        nowhere in the Bible and makes no sense). In effect, it’s like we have an entire population of
                        people who claim to have seen the movie The Goonies but can’t explain the plot — and when they
                        do — it’s about a group of teens who fight a T-Rex.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So if you believe whatever you want, your utmost focus is on yourself, and you can’t explain
                        what
                        your faith teaches, is it any wonder why Christians in America kinda suck? For instance, here’s
                        something to consider. A core tenet of Christianity is called “The Greatest Commandment.” In
                        it,
                        Jesus commands Christians to “love God and your neighbor as yourself.” He explains everything
                        hangs
                        on this simple, yet profound command. A religious expert then challenges him and asks, “Well,
                        who’s
                        my neighbor?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jesus tells a follow-up story that’s now become a pop culture reference entitled “The Good
                        Samaritan.” The story goes that a man is traveling down a road, gets robbed, beaten, and left
                        for
                        dead. A priest and religious man pass him by, but a Samaritan stops and cares for him. Most
                        people
                        assume a Samaritan is someone who stops and does the right thing when others don’t. What
                        everyone
                        misses, however, is that a Samaritan was someone the Jews of antiquity reviled and hated. If we
                        were to recreate the story in America today, it would be the equivalent of a white Klansman
                        stopping to help an African-American member of Antifa. When Jesus asks “Which proved to be the
                        neighbor?” the religious expert is so appalled he can’t even say the word “Samaritan.” Instead
                        he
                        says, “The one who showed mercy.”
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/meme.png" alt="Meme" />
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In today’s culture, people believe <em>“I don’t hate my neighbor, therefore I love them,”</em>
                        but
                        that’s missing the point and not love either. The point of the commandment is that Christians
                        are
                        commanded to love and care for the very people they might despise. The same people who take
                        everything they find holy and spit on it. Then Christ commands them to love their enemy the
                        same
                        way they’d want to be loved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my life, I know I want to be loved without judgement or condemnation. I want people to put
                        up
                        with my shortcomings. I want people with different beliefs to like me and not lash out because
                        I
                        think differently. I’m willing to bet you want to be loved the same way too. <em>So how many
                            Christians do you actually see doing that?</em>

                    <h2>Course Correction</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I first became a Christian several years ago, there wasn’t an instantaneous change. I
                        spent a
                        few years getting hammered at the bar on weekends and hooking up with (or objectifying) women
                        every
                        chance I got. There’s always a learning curve when you’re new to something and you’ll need
                        guides
                        along the path. Several men loved me through multiple mistakes, idiotic remarks about
                        “bitchez,”
                        and general jackassery. Through their patience and kindness, they taught me to live in
                        community,
                        love God, and serve others which began a radical heart change. So much of my needs that were
                        once
                        the focus of my life, became about the needs of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t blame newer Christians for doing dumb things, because I was once them. We don’t know
                        any
                        better. But imagine one day you go to splash pad for children and find a 50-year-old man having
                        the
                        time of his life with a bunch of kids. It’s like a scene straight out of Billy Madison where
                        the
                        guy is sitting on a splash jet saying “That’s nice.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most of us would call the cops believing he might be a pedophile. Or we’d assume the guy might
                        have
                        some mental issues. So when people claim to be Christians and then refuse to love people, judge
                        and
                        condemn them, and continue to act like children, they’re a lot like the old dude at the splash

                        It’s just sad and pathetic, not endearing.

                        Because of this constant Christian infancy we can see played out around us, the Western
                        American
                        church is in the last throes of its death song. You can easily see this as the mark of today’s
                        Christian is constant outrage, especially if something involves politics. If someone says
                        something
                        you disagree with — don’t love them — just attack them. After all, it’s all about you according
                        to
                        our new Christian ideals. Most church services reinforce this focus on self. The vast majority
                        of
                        parishioners go to church to be entertained. If the music, sermon, or kids program isn’t to
                        their
                        flavor, they bounce to a place that “feeds them.” To keep numbers and donations coming, the
                        church
                        bends to the will of the congregation. So if the church reinforces a self-focus, then it's easy
                        to
                        judge and attack others because your needs matter most.

                    <p>
                        When people find out HeartSupport — the organization I work for and whose publication you’re
                        reading — is a Christian organization they’re not surprised. We work in the mental health
                        arena,
                        but we’re pretty open about our faith. A large majority of our community is not Christian
                        (including some of our writers) because we let them know “You’re our neighbor, and we love you
                        regardless of your beliefs.” We don’t have requirements for who we help, either. When people
                        see
                        other people act in love like Christ that’s not a surprise. What’s a surprise to most people
                        are
                        Christians who — with their mouth praise a supposed loving God — then stab other people with
                        the
                        next words out of their lips. The disconnect between belief and action is so traumatic, the
                        whole
                        thing becomes laughable.

                    <p>
                        I’m not saying we do this right or we’re the example to follow because we’ve hurt our fair
                        share of
                        people too. There are no perfect organizations out there, let alone perfect people. But we are
                        trying. We're trying to love people even when we blow it. And how you respond after screwing
                        up — however minor — says a lot about the depth of your faith. Do you respond with love,
                        gentleness, and an apology? Or a defensive posture? One shows you understand Christ’s great
                        command, while the other is once more about how you’re perceived and self focused. Thus, the
                        bad
                        taste left in the mouth of those who interact with Christians has more to do with the fact
                        Christians ignore this simple — yet great — command.

                        So, yes, Christianity isn’t quite “Christian” anymore. But as the West turns its back on those
                        who
                        look nothing like the man they follow, my hope is they’ll turn to meet men and women who do.
                        And
                        perhaps that will change their heart and this world.
